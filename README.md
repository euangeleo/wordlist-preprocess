# wordlist-preprocess
For most SIL dialect intelligibility surveys, wordlists are collected on paper (the batteries last forever!) in IPA, and are then stored in text files. If the surveyor wants to get fancy, they might be stored in a spreadsheet. In order to feed them into a particular tool for analysis (in this case, the version of RuG/L04 string edit distance calculator current in 2008), they need to be in an ASCII-only phonetic alphabet (like XSAMPA), and they need to be in the right format. This Perl script takes wordlists in Unicode IPA and converts them to XSAMPA, in a format that can be used with RuG/L04.
